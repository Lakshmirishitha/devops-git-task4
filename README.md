# DevOps Git Task 4

This is a version-controlled DevOps practice project as part of an internship task. The main objective is to demonstrate the use of Git and GitHub effectively using branching, pull requests, commits, and tags.

## 🚀 What I Did

- Initialized a Git repository and connected it to GitHub
- Created the following branches:
  - `main`
  - `dev`
  - `feature`
- Made changes in the `feature` branch and created a pull request to merge into `dev`
- Used `.gitignore` to ignore unnecessary files
- Added meaningful commit messages
- Tagged the project as `v1.0` using Git tags

## 📁 Files Included

- `README.md` - Project explanation
- `.gitignore` - Ignores node_modules, .env files, etc.
- `main.txt` - Sample file used to test branching and pull requests

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Git
- GitHub
- Visual Studio Code

## 📌 Final Outcome

- Learned how to use Git effectively in a DevOps project
- Practiced branching, pull requests, tagging, and proper commits
